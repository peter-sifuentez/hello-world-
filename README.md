# hello-world-
I am a retail worker looking to make a career change in my life by learning to write code. 
I want to build apps and technology that can be the next unicorn.  
Besides wanting to learn to code, I love workout, play soccer, drink beer, and shoot guns.
Also I love to play video games on the PS4 and PC.
